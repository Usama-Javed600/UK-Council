# {{ page.title }}

We’re here to help colleagues across Essex County Council.

This list of services is tied to the sorts of needs our colleagues often have, and the problems they often describe.

It’s not an exhaustive list: if your exact problem isn’t on here, we can still help you. We’re very flexible, so we can come up with a way of helping you that’s tailor-made to help your team with your problem.

Contact us to find out more.

<td>Residents can’t find the information they need, increasing demand on the call centre</td>
<td>Our service designers can help understand the whole user journey, end-to-end. We can apply user research and content design to understand the cause of the problem, and design ways to help people find the information more easily.

<td>We would like to do our own user research, but we are not sure how</td>
<td>Our user researchers can provide expert guidance to help keep you on the right track</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Our team or function is bogged down in process - we think there’s a better way, but we don’t know where to start</td>
<td>The business design team can help you better understand the system you work in, and take an end-to-end look at the processes within it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We don’t know if our team or function is set up for success</td>
<td>We can use organisational design to review how your team works, and suggest a redesign if necessary</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Residents find it hard to use our service</td>
<td>We can use a combination of many of these techniques to find out why, and suggest new approaches; maybe a digital service on the web, maybe a rethink of our your team works, maybe a combination of both</td>
