# What to do with FAQs

Frequently asked questions (FAQs) don’t make good web content. The [Government Digital Service (GDS) discourages them](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk).  
  
If the information is unique, you can help people read it by structuring it and taking it out of the questions and answers format.

## Headings

Headings are important because they jump out at the user and when written well can help users navigate quickly.  
  
Use statement for your headings, rather than questions. You can front load the headings with the keywords.  
  
For example, instead of ‘How do I apply for a school place?’, say ‘Apply for a school place’.

## Structure

Create a logical structure, grouping information about the same topic together, using headings and sub-headings.  
  
Start with the most important point or action. You don’t need to write a lot of background information.

## Avoid repetition

Several questions may have the same answer. You should group these together using a single heading.

## Keep things short

Write in short sentences and short paragraphs, broken up with bullet points wherever you are listing several items.

## Example before:

### How were applications considered and places allocated? 

All applications have to be considered against the admission arrangements and oversubscription criteria for schools. These can also be found in the booklets referred to above. 
 
Applications are ranked against the oversubscription criteria for each school for which a parent applied, and a place offered at the highest of the ranked preferences that can be met.   

Where a place cannot be offered at any of the schools for which you applied, a place is offered at the nearest Essex school to the home with an available place.    

### Can I now apply for a different school? 

Yes. Remember that you should not reject the school offer you have until you have secured another place as there is no guarantee a different school will have spare places. 

If you want to apply for a school for which you did not apply originally, you should email [admissions@essex.gov.uk](mailto:admissions@essex.gov.uk) to request a place at that school. 

Some parents decide that they would prefer a school that they ranked lower on their original application than the school offered. If that school has places available, it may be possible to offer a place. If there are no spare places, your child can be added to the waiting list. To request this, you should also email [admissions@essex.gov.uk](mailto:admissions@essex.gov.uk). 

### Can I appeal against the refusal of a place? 

You have the legal right to appeal to an independent appeal panel against the decision not to admit your child at any of your preferred schools for which you have not been offered a place. See further details about the [appeals process and deadlines](https://www.essex.gov.uk/Education-Schools/Schools/Admissions/Pages/Appeals.aspx).  

## Example after:

### How we allocate school places  

We use the admission arrangements and school oversubscription criteria to allocate places. Find out more about the [school admission arrangements](https://www.essex.gov.uk/topic/admissions).   

### Apply to a different school  

Don’t reject your school offer until you have secured another school place. There is no guarantee a different school will have spare places.  

If you want to apply to a school that you didn’t apply to originally, you should email [admissions@essex.gov.uk](mailto:admissions@essex.gov.uk) to request a place at that school.  

If you prefer a school ranked lower on your application than the school you’re offered, email [admissions@essex.gov.uk](mailto:admissions@essex.gov.uk) to request this. If that school has places available, your child might get a place. If there are no places available, your child will go on the waiting list.  

### Appeal against an admission decision  

You have the right to appeal against a school offer. See more details about the [appeals process and deadlines](https://www.essex.gov.uk/Education-Schools/Schools/Admissions/Pages/Appeals.aspx).
