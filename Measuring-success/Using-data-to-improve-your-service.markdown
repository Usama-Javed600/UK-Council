## Why data is important 

Collecting data about your service allows you to measure its performance. 

Data can show you if: 

- the service is meeting user needs
- the service allows users to easily complete the task it provides
- there are enough people using the service to make it cost-efficient
- people know about the service and are choosing to use it 

## Setting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

KPIs are a way of measuring performance. Having clear objectives and the right metrics will tell you if the service is solving the problem it’s meant to. 

Think about: 

- the objectives of your service 
- individual goals for each objective 
- your KPIs for each goal 
- the targets for your KPIs  

## Web measurement framework 

A web measurement forms the basis of reports and dashboards and will change slightly from service to service. 

[See an example of a web measurement framework we use at Essex County Council (ECC) for measuring performance]({{site.baseurl}}/Measuring-success/Google-analytics/Ecc-web-analytics-framework).

## How to use data  

When you’ve collected data about your service, it’s important to use it to help you make improvements. 

This includes: 

- [measuring and reviewing content](/essex-county-council-digital-manual/Content-standards/Content-guidelines/Measuring-and-reviewing-content) to make sure it’s meeting user needs
- working with a user researcher to understand why people are behaving in certain ways
- reviewing call centre data to identify common queries
- reviewing financial information, for example, how much your service costing, to make sure it’s value for money
