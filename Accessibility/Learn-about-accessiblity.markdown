Training and useful resources to help you learn about accessibility.  

## Training  

We’re developing an accessibility training module for employees on My Learning and hope to launch this in autumn 2020. 

[W3C’s Introduction to Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction) is a free online course to complete at your own pace. 
 
## Useful resources  

Sign up to the [GOV.UK accessibility blog](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/). 

Join the [GOV.UK accessibility community](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community) and talk to other people across government with an interest in accessibility. 

[Digital accessibility for government communicators](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/webinars/digital-accessibility-for-government-communicators/) is a useful webinar run by the Government Communication Service (GCS). 

[Web accessibility perspectives by W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) are a series of videos that show how accessible design helps people with disabilities.
