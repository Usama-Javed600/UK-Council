# {{ page.title }}

Identify one of the 7 service patterns across our services. 

## Check something 

The check something pattern allows a user to look up information and understand if it applies to them. The information might be about their eligibility, status or location. 

This is usually the first pattern in a user’s journey. It helps people make decisions early on before they engage with a service. For example, an eligibility check.  

The pattern also keeps users up to date after they’ve used a service. Follow one of the 3 scenarios under the ‘check something’ pattern.  

The scenarios we've developed are: 

- [Check before you apply]()
- [Check my nearest or most relevant]()

The scenario still to be developed is: 

- Check to understand something 

## Apply for something 

The 'apply for something' pattern allows a user to receive or access a service. When applying for a service, the service is responsible for authorising an outcome for the user. 

The user will follow the 'check something' pattern before using the ‘apply for something’ pattern. 

Applications ask for personal and sensitive information, so we must keep the information safe and secure. 

Think about whether an application is essential to help the decision making practice. 

If there’s no eligibility criteria, then consider moving users to a ‘book’ or ‘register’ pattern to continue their access to a service. Follow one of the 5 scenarios under the ‘apply for something’ pattern. 

The scenario we've developed is: 

- [apply for something we do]()

The scenarios still under development are: 

- apply for a role or job
- apply for a grant
- apply for permission to do something myself
- apply to appeal a decision 

## Tell something 

Tell something helps users to tell us something. Typically to update us about changes in circumstance. 

The scenarios still under development are: 

- report something
- report a safeguarding or legal concern
- feedback about something
- refer someone
- respond to something
- create to share
- update something 

## Request something 

Request something helps users to get something they want. Usually, there is no eligibility check as the user is entitled to what they want by default. 

The scenarios still under development are: 

- request information 
- request financial compensation 
- request support from us 
- request to be added to something 

## Register something 

Register something helps users to complete a process. Users will create an account with personal and sensitive data that they can return to. 

The scenarios still under development are: 

- register to create a thing
- register to apply for a role 
- register to access an existing service, scheme or entitlement 

## Pay for something 

Pay for something helps users to transfer money to us. 

The scenarios still under development are: 

- pay for an official status, record or event
- pay to manage my account
- pay for an activity or service
- pay to donate or support a service 

## Book something 

The ‘book something’ pattern helps users to book something. For example a room, an item or someone’s time. Most of these ask the user to choose a date and time. Follow one of the 4 scenarios under the ‘book something’ pattern.  

The scenario we've developed is: 

- [book onto an event that already exists]()

The scenarios still under development are: 

- book an appointment 
- book an asset 
- book a place
